# Starter
This is the most basic setup with babel to make use of all the latest features of JS on Node.js

# Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/javascriptonian/starter`  
or download the zip and extract to a directory.
- cd into the root directory of the project folder with the command `cd starter`.
- Install the dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`.
- Wait until the depencies are all installed.

# Running the app
- After installation, you can then run the code with `npm start` or `yarn start`.
- This command will start a process that watches your project folder for changes and reruns the code whenever you save the changes.
- You can also only run the app once with `npm run once` or `yarn run once`.
